					<h1>Hiking and Camping out of Big Pine</h1>
					<p>
						Big Pine is next to dozens of hiking trails of varying difficulties
						and camp sites. Being a very popular hikers town, Big Pine trails
						are very active and well maintained by the community. These same
						trails have existed since before the 1930's, well before the LADWP
						installed the man-made lakes, however, many trails go around the
						lakes and rivers that were created due to this undertaking.

					<h2>Common Trails</h2>
					<p>
						Some of the amazing trails that are within 10 miles of the town
						include the Big Pine Lakes Trail, which has a length of 15.2 miles,
						as well as the Palisade Glacier Trail which is 15.9 miles. These are
						both great challenges and are not recommended for unexperienced
						hikers to undertake, there have been deaths on these trails are
						getting lost is a very real possibility as well as getting attacked
						by a wild animal.

						There are also trails for the family such as the Big Pine Creek
						Campground and Glacier Lodge Loop that would take under an hour to
						walk and are very pet and children friendly. Being a little under
						1.5 miles, this is ideal to get some fresh air as well as taking in
						the view of the Owens Valley.

					<h2>Camping Near Big Pine</h2>
					<p>
						Big Pine, other than camping out while out on a trail, also has
						designated camp grounds for people looking to escape technology for
						some time. There are campgrounds found as high at 7,700 ft.
						elevation to the base of the valley where natural hot springs exist.
						Keough's Hot Springs is one of these locations. It was established
						in 1919 and has been remodeled continuously through the decades.
						With natural hotsprings as well as 1 jacuuzi and 1 pool being filed
						with natural spring water weekly, Keough's Hot Spring is a great
						place to go camping at. They also have options as to how you want to
						stay here from camping, RV sites and Rustic Funished Tent Cabins.
